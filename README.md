-----Iris-Flower-Classification-----
 The Iris flower dataset is a popular dataset commonly used for tasks in pattern  recognition and classification.  It includes data on three Iris flower species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, with  measurements of four key features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal  width. This project involves building machine learning model
Hereâ€™s a proposed documentation file for your GitHub repository based on your **Iris Flower Classification** project:
